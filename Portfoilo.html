        <ul>
            <li><h3>Freelance</h3></li>
            <p>Freelancing is a fantastic career choice, especially when you have a passion
                 for the skill you want to be paid for. It allows you to shape your workday. 
                 However, it is hard work in the first few months and years.

                The rise of freelancers has resulted in the development of a new concept  
                the gig economy. In the gig economy, a person, instead of working for a single 
                employer full-time and getting a fixed salary in return,
                 works for multiple clients at his terms and price, he thinks his work deserves.</p>
